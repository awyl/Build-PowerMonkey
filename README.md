# Build PowerMonkey

## <u>DISCLAIMER</u>  
I merely provide you a script to build PowerMoney EFI because it is not the easiest task.  Using these EFI binaries are potentially dangerous and could damage your computer.  I am not responsible for any damages that might cause.  Use at your own risk.

A [blog post](https://mreggtart.com/posts/undervolting-windows-11-powermonkey) is written for this repository.

These scripts are created to ease the so many steps to build [PowerMonkey](https://github.com/psyq321/PowerMonkey).  If you do not understand what you are doing, you probably shouldn't be running this.  Read about EFI and boot process.  PowerMonkey github has a good explanation.


## Software Used
- https://github.com/tianocore/edk2 stable202108
- https://github.com/psyq321/PowerMonkey 0.14
- Python 3.10.0
- NASM 2.15.05

## How to use

### Prerequisite
1. Windows 10 build 17063 and newer
2. Visual Studio 2019, with C++ workload installed.

### Step 1
In a command prompt (Use `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` to get builds working),
```
git clone https://github.com/awyl/Build-PowerMonkey.git
```

### Step 2
```
cd Build-PowerMonkey
setup.bat
```

### Step 3

Edit `CONFIGURATION.c`.  Set your undervolt value.  
Open the file in a text editor, it should be very self-explanatory.

### Step 4
```
build.bat
```

### Step 5
Copy the content of `EFI` folder to the folder of same name in your EFI partition.  You can also copy the folder to an FAT32 formatted usb stick. If you use usb stick, you should replace `fs0` in `startup.nsh` to `fs1`.

### Step 6

Reboot your computer and go into BIOS.
- Turn off `Secure Boot`
- Change the boot file to `EFI\Boot\shellx64.efi`.
